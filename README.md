# MarvinVoiceActivation

This project focuses on creating a voice activation model which detects a trigger word, and performs specific actions...

The model was built using synthetic voice data using both positive and negative samples. Background noise is used to add randomness to the data to work better in real world application. 

#Folder Structure

build :: consists of two files which are used in building and training the deep learning model used for trigger word detection...

models :: contains the trained model files used for inference...

Pycharm_Inference :: consists files used in running the inference script...

Marvin_Activation_Problem.ipynb :: colab file used for building and saving the model(works  with build folder)....

main.py :: script files that should be run for inference and to see the model in action(works with models and Pycharm_Inference folders)...
